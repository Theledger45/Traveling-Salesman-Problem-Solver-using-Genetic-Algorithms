# Traveling-Salesman-Problem-Solver-using-Genetic-Algorithms
A Python implementation of a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) with an interactive GUI visualization. This project demonstrates the application of evolutionary optimization techniques to find near-optimal solutions for route optimization challenges.
